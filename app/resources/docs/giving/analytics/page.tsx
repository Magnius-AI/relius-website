      <h1>Giving Analytics</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Quick Summary</strong>: Understand your church's financial health with comprehensive dashboards, trend analysis, and actionable insights that inform ministry decisions and donor engagement.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Numbers tell stories. Behind every giving report is a narrative about your congregation's faith, priorities, and engagement with your church's mission. Giving analytics transforms raw donation data into insights that help you make wise decisions—when to launch a campaign, how to forecast budgets, which ministries are capturing hearts, and where donor engagement might be slipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relius provides intuitive dashboards that answer questions like: "Is giving up or down compared to last year?" "What percentage of our members give regularly?" "How did our Easter offering compare to previous years?" "Are we retaining donors or constantly replacing them?" You don't need a finance degree to understand these reports—clear visualizations make trends obvious at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        But analytics aren't just about looking backward. Predictive insights help you plan ahead: forecast end-of-year giving based on current trends, identify donors at risk of lapsing before they stop giving, and model the impact of campaigns on overall revenue. When you understand your giving patterns, you can lead with confidence and steward your church's resources with excellence.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Giving Dashboard</strong>: A visual summary of key metrics including totals, trends, comparisons, and donor health</li>
        <li><strong>Donor Retention Rate</strong>: Percentage of donors from last year who gave again this year—higher is better</li>
        <li><strong>Average Gift Size</strong>: Total donations divided by number of gifts; tracks engagement depth</li>
        <li><strong>Giving Frequency</strong>: How often donors give (weekly, monthly, quarterly, one-time)</li>
        <li><strong>Year-over-Year (YoY)</strong>: Comparison of this year's performance vs. the same period last year</li>
        <li><strong>Forecast</strong>: Projected giving based on historical trends and current data</li>
        <li><strong>Fund Distribution</strong>: How donations split across different funds (General, Missions, Building, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Access the Giving Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Navigate to <strong>Giving → Analytics</strong> from your main dashboard. You'll see an overview with key metrics: total giving (month, quarter, year), donor count, average gift size, and quick comparisons to previous periods. This is your financial pulse—check it weekly for awareness.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Explore Pre-Built Reports</h3>
      <p>
        Click on any metric to drill deeper. Relius includes pre-built reports for common questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly Giving Trends</strong> – Line chart showing giving over time</li>
        <li><strong>Donor Breakdown</strong> – Pie chart of major, regular, and occasional donors</li>
        <li><strong>Fund Comparison</strong> – Bar chart of giving by fund</li>
        <li><strong>Year-over-Year Summary</strong> – Side-by-side comparison with previous year</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring vs. One-Time</strong> – Percentage of giving that's automated</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3: Create Custom Reports</h3>

      <h2>Features</h2>

      <h3>Giving Dashboard Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The main dashboard provides at-a-glance health indicators:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Giving</strong> – This month, this quarter, year-to-date, and trailing 12 months</li>
        <li><strong>Active Donors</strong> – Number of unique individuals who gave in the selected period</li>
        <li><strong>Average Gift</strong> – Tells you if donors are giving more or less per transaction</li>
        <li><strong>Giving Change</strong> – Percentage up or down compared to last month/quarter/year</li>
        <li><strong>Top Funds</strong> – Which designations are receiving the most support</li>
        <li><strong>Recent Donations</strong> – Live feed of the latest gifts (amounts, names if permitted)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Color-coded indicators (green for growth, red for decline, yellow for caution) help you spot issues instantly. A quick glance tells you if you're tracking ahead of budget or need to sound an alarm.
      </p>

      <h3>Trend Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Trends reveal patterns invisible in monthly totals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seasonal patterns</strong> – Most churches see giving peaks in December and dips in summer. Knowing this helps you plan and not panic during slow months.</li>
        <li><strong>Campaign impact</strong> – See the bump (and subsequent return to baseline) when you run special campaigns</li>
        <li><strong>Growth trajectory</strong> – Are you trending up over years, plateauing, or declining?</li>
        <li><strong>Sunday-by-Sunday</strong> – Some Sundays consistently outperform others (like Commitment Sunday or Easter)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        View trends in multiple timeframes: weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Compare year-over-year to control for seasonality—is September 2024 better than September 2023?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example: You notice giving drops 30% every July and August. Rather than panicking, you recognize this is consistent with vacation season. Plan a mid-summer stewardship reminder emphasizing recurring giving to smooth out the dip.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Forecasting</h3>
      <p>
        Predict where you'll land based on current trends:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>End-of-Year Projection</strong> – Based on giving so far and historical patterns, estimate December 31 total</li>
        <li><strong>Budget Comparison</strong> – Are you on track to meet your annual budget? Ahead? Behind?</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario Modeling</strong> – "If we add 20 new recurring donors at $100/month, what's the annual impact?"</li>
        <li><strong>Campaign Goal Projection</strong> – For active campaigns, estimate completion date based on current velocity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Forecasts are especially valuable for finance committees and elder boards who need to make decisions about staffing, programs, and capital investments. Better predictions lead to better planning.
      </p>

      <h3>Donor Health Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding your donor base is as important as understanding donation totals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donor Retention Rate</strong> – What percentage of 2023 donors gave again in 2024? Healthy churches retain 70-85%.</li>
        <li><strong>New Donor Acquisition</strong> – How many first-time donors per month? Is the base growing?</li>
        <li><strong>Lapsed Donor Count</strong> – How many previous donors haven't given in 90+ days?</li>
        <li><strong>Giving Frequency Distribution</strong> – What percentage give weekly, monthly, quarterly, or once?</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring Giving Rate</strong> – Percentage of total giving that comes from automated recurring gifts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        High retention and strong recurring giving create financial stability. If retention is low (below 60%) or recurring is minimal (below 30%), focus on donor engagement before launching new campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example: Your retention rate dropped from 75% to 62%. Investigation reveals many lapsed donors are families with teenagers who graduated and left town. This is natural lifecycle, not a problem—but now you know to invest in engaging younger families.</em>
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Advanced Features</summary>
        
        <h4>Giving Cohort Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Track donors by when they started giving. The "2020 cohort" is everyone who made their first gift in 2020. Watch each cohort over time: What percentage of 2020 first-time donors gave in 2021? 2022? 2023? Cohort analysis reveals whether you're building long-term givers or experiencing churn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthy pattern: 60%+ of new donors give again in year 2, 50%+ in year 3, 45%+ in year 4 (then stable). If year-2 retention is below 40%, your new-donor engagement process needs work.
        </p>

        <h4>Donor Pyramid Visualization</h4>
        <p>
          A pyramid chart shows giving distribution: a few major donors at the top, more mid-level donors in the middle, and many smaller donors at the base. Healthy churches have a balanced pyramid. An inverted pyramid (top-heavy) is risky—if major donors leave, giving collapses. Use this to identify if you need to cultivate more mid-level givers.
        </p>

        <h4>Giving Velocity Tracking</h4>
        <p>
          Measure the rate of giving acceleration or deceleration. Are donations speeding up (momentum building) or slowing down (energy fading)? Especially useful during campaigns—if velocity drops mid-campaign, you need a push.
        </p>

        <h4>Fund Performance Comparison</h4>
        <p>
          Compare how different funds perform over time. Is the Building Fund growing while Missions giving declines? Are special offerings cannibalizing General Fund giving, or adding to it? Fund analysis informs ministry prioritization and communication strategy.
        </p>

        <h4>Geographic Giving Distribution</h4>
        <p>
          If you have location data, see where your donors live. Multi-campus churches can compare giving by campus. Any church can identify zip codes or neighborhoods with high engagement—and those with unrealized potential.
        </p>

        <h4>Giving by Age/Generation</h4>
        <p>
          Analyze giving patterns across generations: Builders, Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z. Younger generations give differently (more online, smaller but consistent, cause-focused). Understanding generational patterns helps you tailor communication and giving methods.
        </p>

        <h4>AI-Powered Insights</h4>
        <p>
          Relius's AI Donations Manager surfaces insights you might miss: "15 donors who gave over $1,000 last year haven't given in 60 days" or "Giving dropped 12% after the sermon on money—consider follow-up communication." These smart nudges turn data into action.
        </p>

        <h4>Board-Ready Reports</h4>
        <p>
          One-click generation of professional reports for elder boards, finance committees, or denominational reporting. Include executive summaries, visualizations, and key takeaways. Schedule automatic monthly delivery to leadership email addresses.
        </p>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the dashboard weekly</strong> – Early awareness prevents surprises; don't wait for monthly finance meetings</li>
        <li><strong>Compare year-over-year, not just month-over-month</strong> – Seasonal variations are normal; YoY controls for them</li>
        <li><strong>Track retention as closely as totals</strong> – Growing total giving with declining retention is unsustainable</li>
        <li><strong>Set realistic benchmarks</strong> – Compare to your own history first, then industry benchmarks</li>
        <li><strong>Use forecasts for planning, not just reporting</strong> – Share projections with leadership to inform decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate wins</strong> – When giving is up or retention improves, acknowledge and thank the congregation</li>
        <li><strong>Act on insights</strong> – Data without action is just noise; use analytics to inform outreach and campaigns</li>
        <li><strong>Don't obsess</strong> – Check regularly, but don't check hourly. Weekly is plenty for most situations</li>
        <li><strong>Present context</strong> – When sharing with boards, explain what's normal and what's concerning</li>
        <li><strong>Combine data with pastoral wisdom</strong> – Numbers inform but don't replace prayer, discernment, and relationships</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-World Scenarios</h2>

      <h3>Scenario 1: Annual Budget Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        The finance committee needs to set next year's budget. You pull year-over-year trends showing 4% average annual growth for the past 5 years. You show donor retention at 78% (healthy), with recurring giving representing 45% of total donations. Forecasting based on current trends, you project $1.2M for next year. The committee confidently approves a $1.15M budget with appropriate margin.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario 2: Campaign Momentum Check</h3>
      <p>
        Midway through your building campaign, you check analytics. Goal: $500K. Raised: $180K. Velocity has slowed from $15K/week to $8K/week. At current pace, you'll hit $320K by deadline. This data triggers action: you plan a renewed push with personal asks to major donors, a celebration of progress to date, and a special "finish strong" emphasis in services. Result: campaign closes at $485K.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario 3: Lapsed Donor Recovery</h3>
      <p>
        Analytics show 45 donors who gave $500+ last year haven't given in 90 days. You segment this list and craft a personal outreach: "We noticed you haven't connected with us recently and wanted to check in. Is everything okay?" Of the 45, 8 respond with changed circumstances (job loss, moved away), 12 resume giving within a month, and 15 never respond. You've recovered significant giving and shown pastoral care—both wins.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario 4: Summer Slump Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Historical trends show giving drops 25% in June-August. In May, you proactively emphasize recurring giving: "Set up automated giving before summer vacations so your generosity continues even when you're away." You also schedule mid-summer stewardship reminders. Result: summer dip reduced to 15%, and recurring giving increases by 20%.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Q: What's a healthy donor retention rate?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Most healthy churches retain 70-85% of donors year-over-year. Below 60% is concerning and suggests engagement issues. Above 85% is excellent. Track your own trend—improving from 65% to 72% is a win even if you're not at 80%.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: How much of our giving should be recurring?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Aim for 40-60% of total giving from recurring automated gifts. This creates financial stability and helps donors maintain consistent generosity. Churches with strong online giving typically see higher recurring percentages. If below 30%, promote recurring giving more intentionally.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: Is it bad if most of our giving comes from a few major donors?</strong></p>
      <p>A: It's risky. If your top 10 donors represent 50%+ of giving, you're vulnerable to major disruption if any of them leave or face financial hardship. Work to broaden your donor base while maintaining major donor relationships. A balanced pyramid is healthiest.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: How accurate are giving forecasts?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Forecasts based on 3+ years of data are typically accurate within 5-10%. Newer churches or those with major changes (pastor transition, building project, pandemic) may see wider variation. Use forecasts as guides, not guarantees, and update them quarterly as new data arrives.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: What does it mean if average gift size is dropping?</strong></p>
      <p>A: It could mean: (1) more new donors giving smaller first gifts (often good—base is growing), (2) existing donors reducing giving due to economic factors, or (3) fewer major gifts. Drill into the data to understand the driver before reacting. Sometimes smaller average gifts with more donors equals more total giving.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: How often should we share giving analytics with the congregation?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Annually at minimum (year-end review, budget presentation). Quarterly updates maintain transparency. Campaign-specific updates should be frequent (weekly thermometer progress). Avoid over-communication—too many money messages can feel transactional.</p>
