        <p><strong>Quick Summary</strong>: Create ministry teams with defined positions, roles, and leaders to organize volunteers for worship, tech, hospitality, children's ministry, and more.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Every thriving church runs on teams. From the worship band that leads Sunday morning to the tech crew managing sound and lights, from greeters who welcome newcomers to teachers shaping young hearts—ministry happens through organized groups of committed volunteers. Teams in Relius bring structure and clarity to these essential groups, making it easy to define who does what, who leads whom, and how everyone communicates.
      </p>
      <p>
        A team in Relius is more than just a list of names. It's a complete organizational unit with positions (roles like "Worship Leader," "Sound Tech," or "2nd Grade Teacher"), members assigned to those positions, leaders who coordinate and communicate, and preferences that guide scheduling. When you create a team, you're building the foundation for all your service planning and volunteer scheduling—everything else flows from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of teams as the building blocks of your volunteer ministry. Once you define your Worship Team with its positions and members, scheduling worship volunteers becomes as simple as "fill these positions for next Sunday." The system knows who can do what, who's available, who's overcommitted, and who needs to be contacted. Teams transform chaos into coordination.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Team</strong>: A ministry group working toward a common purpose (Worship Team, Hospitality Team, Kids Ministry, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Position</strong>: A specific role within a team (Worship Leader, Bass Player, Greeter, 3rd Grade Teacher)</li>
        <li><strong>Team Member</strong>: A volunteer assigned to one or more positions on a team</li>
        <li><strong>Team Leader</strong>: The person responsible for coordinating the team, communicating with members, and ensuring coverage</li>
        <li><strong>Skills/Qualifications</strong>: Requirements for a position (background check for kids ministry, proficiency level for musicians)</li>
        <li><strong>Bench Strength</strong>: How many people can fill a given position (critical if you only have one sound tech!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Navigate to Teams</h3>
      <p>
        From your dashboard, click <strong>Services</strong> in the main navigation, then select <strong>Teams</strong>. Click the <strong>Create Team</strong> button to begin setting up your first ministry team.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Define Team Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Give your team a name (like "Worship Team," "Sunday Morning Tech," or "Hospitality Ministry"), add a description of the team's purpose, and assign a team leader who will coordinate volunteers and communicate with the group. You can also set team-wide preferences like preferred service times or communication channels.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: Create Positions</h3>
      <p>
        Add all the positions your team needs. For a worship team, this might include Worship Leader, Vocalists (you can have multiple people in one position), Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass, Keys, Drums, and Background Vocals. For each position, specify if it requires special skills, background checks, or training.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Add Team Members</h3>
      <p>
        Search your member directory and add volunteers to the team. Assign each person to the positions they can fill. Someone might be qualified for multiple positions (like a person who can play both keys and acoustic guitar), giving you flexibility in scheduling. Set each member's availability preferences and service frequency limits.
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>

      <h3>Creating Ministry Teams</h3>
      <p>
        Start by identifying all the distinct ministry teams in your church. Common teams include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Worship Team</strong>: Musicians, vocalists, worship leaders</li>
        <li><strong>Tech Team</strong>: Sound engineers, lighting operators, video/streaming crew, presentation slides</li>
        <li><strong>Hospitality Team</strong>: Greeters, ushers, coffee/refreshments, parking attendants</li>
        <li><strong>Children's Ministry</strong>: Nursery workers, preschool teachers, elementary leaders, check-in volunteers</li>
        <li><strong>Youth Ministry</strong>: Youth leaders, small group facilitators, event coordinators</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer Team</strong>: Altar ministry, prayer room volunteers</li>
        <li><strong>Production Team</strong>: Camera operators, livestream managers, social media posting</li>
        <li><strong>Setup/Teardown Crew</strong>: Stage setup, equipment management, facilities prep</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each team should have a clear purpose and scope. Don't create mega-teams that try to cover everything—better to have focused teams with specific responsibilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Defining Team Positions</h3>
      <p>
        Positions are the specific roles within a team. Be specific but not overly granular. For a tech team, "Sound Engineer" is better than splitting into "Front of House Sound" and "Monitor Mix" unless you truly have different people for those roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example: Your worship team positions might include: Worship Leader (1 needed per service), Lead Vocalist (1-2 per service), Background Vocals (2-3 per service), Acoustic Guitar (0-1 per service), Electric Guitar (0-1 per service), Bass (1 per service), Keys (0-1 per service), Drums (1 per service). The numbers in parentheses indicate typical staffing needs.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Assigning Team Members</h3>
      <p>
        Once positions exist, assign volunteers to the positions they're qualified to fill. Pull from your member directory—all the contact info, availability, and skills are already there. You can assign someone to multiple positions if they're multi-talented, but be careful not to schedule them for conflicting roles in the same service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set each member's preferences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service frequency</strong>: How often they want to serve (e.g., "2 times per month maximum")</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred service times</strong>: Some people can only do first service, others prefer later</li>
        <li><strong>Blackout dates</strong>: Vacations, recurring commitments, or requested time off</li>
        <li><strong>Skill level</strong>: Beginner, intermediate, advanced (helps with planning; don't schedule all beginners on the same day)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Team Leaders and Coordinators</h3>
      <p>
        Every team should have at least one leader. This person doesn't have to be the most skilled musician or techie—they need to be organized, good at communication, and committed to the team's success. Team leaders get special permissions to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>View and edit the team roster</li>
        <li>Approve or decline schedule assignments</li>
        <li>Send messages to the whole team or specific members</li>
        <li>Track team health metrics (attendance, engagement, burnout risk)</li>
        <li>Submit volunteer needs to staff</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For larger teams, consider co-leaders or position captains (like a "Drum Captain" who coordinates all the drummers and handles instrument maintenance).
      </p>

      <h3>Team Communication Channels</h3>
      <p>
        Each team can have its own communication preferences. Some teams love group texts; others prefer email; some use dedicated Slack channels or WhatsApp groups. Set this in the team settings so messages route correctly. You can also create team-specific announcement channels for things like "Worship Team: New song to learn this week" or "Tech Team: Equipment training session next Saturday."
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Advanced Options</summary>
        
        <h4>Position Requirements and Skills Tracking</h4>
        <p>
          Set specific requirements for positions that need them. Children's ministry positions should require background checks; sound tech roles might require certification or training completion. Relius tracks which team members have completed requirements and flags anyone who's expired (like background checks older than 2 years).
        </p>
        <p>
          Create skill tags like "CCLI Certified," "ProPresenter Trained," "Infant CPR," or "Bilingual Spanish" to filter volunteers for specific needs.
        </p>

        <h4>Sub-Teams and Rotating Groups</h4>
        <p>
          For large teams, create sub-teams or rotating groups. Your hospitality team might have "Group A" and "Group B" that alternate Sundays. Your worship team could have "Contemporary Band" and "Traditional Ensemble" for different service styles. Sub-teams share the parent team's purpose but have distinct member lists and schedules.
        </p>

        <h4>Multi-Site Team Management</h4>
        <p>
          Churches with multiple campuses can create site-specific teams or shared teams that serve multiple locations. Set site preferences so the tech team at Campus A doesn't get scheduled for Campus B unless they've opted in.
        </p>

        <h4>Apprentice and Training Positions</h4>
        <p>
          Create "apprentice" or "in-training" positions for volunteers learning a new role. They can shadow experienced team members without being counted toward staffing requirements. Once trained, promote them to full position status.
        </p>

        <h4>Team Analytics and Health Metrics</h4>
        <p>
          View team health dashboards showing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bench strength (how many people can fill each position)</li>
          <li>Service frequency by member (who's overworked, who's underutilized)</li>
          <li>Attendance and reliability metrics (who consistently shows up vs. frequent cancellations)</li>
          <li>Recruitment needs (positions with insufficient coverage)</li>
          <li>Engagement trends (are team members accepting assignments or declining more often?)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Team Budget and Resource Allocation</h4>
        <p>
          Assign budget line items to teams for things like equipment, training, appreciation events, or supplies. Track spending by team to understand resource allocation across ministries.
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with your biggest team</strong> – Usually worship or tech; success here builds momentum for other teams</li>
        <li><strong>Be realistic about positions</strong> – Don't create 15 positions if you only have 8 volunteers; start small and expand</li>
        <li><strong>Honor volunteer preferences</strong> – If someone says "maximum 2x per month," respect that boundary rigorously</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain bench strength</strong> – Aim for 3-4 people per critical position so you're never scrambling</li>
        <li><strong>Empower team leaders</strong> – Give them the tools and authority to manage their teams without constant staff approval</li>
        <li><strong>Update team rosters quarterly</strong> – People's availability and commitments change; check in regularly</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate team wins</strong> – Recognize teams publicly, host appreciation events, send thank-you notes</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-train when possible</strong> – Multi-skilled team members give you flexibility and resilience</li>
        <li><strong>Track but don't obsess over skills</strong> – Willingness and reliability often matter more than technical perfection</li>
        <li><strong>Create clear onboarding</strong> – New team members should know exactly what to expect, where to show up, and who to ask</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Q: How many people should be on a team?</strong></p>
      <p>A: It depends on the team's purpose and service frequency. A worship team serving weekly might need 20+ people to rotate through positions without burnout. A setup crew serving monthly might only need 6-8. Aim for 3-4x the number of positions if serving weekly.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: Can someone be on multiple teams?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Absolutely! Many volunteers serve on 2-3 teams (like worship and hospitality). Relius tracks their total commitment across all teams to prevent burnout. Just be careful about scheduling conflicts—someone can't be a greeter and a kids ministry teacher at the same time.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: What if we don't have enough volunteers to fill a team?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Create the team structure anyway with the volunteers you have, then use the gap analysis report to identify specific recruitment needs. It's easier to recruit when you can say "we need 2 more bass players" than "we need volunteers for worship."</p>

      <p><strong>Q: How do we handle volunteers who are unreliable?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Relius tracks no-shows and last-minute cancellations. If patterns emerge, the team leader should have a pastoral conversation about fit and commitment. Some people are better suited for on-call/backup roles rather than regular rotation.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: Can volunteers see other team members and contact them?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Team leaders can enable team directories that show member names, positions, and contact info (if volunteers have opted in to sharing). This helps with coordination like "I can't make my shift, can you swap with me?"</p>

      <p><strong>Q: Should we combine similar teams or keep them separate?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Keep teams separate if they serve at different times or have different leaders. Combine them if they're really the same people doing the same work. For example, "Sunday Greeters" and "Wednesday Night Greeters" are probably one Hospitality Team with different service times.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Scenarios</h2>

      <h3>Scenario: Building a New Worship Team</h3>
      <p>
        Grace Community is launching a Saturday evening contemporary service and needs a dedicated worship team. They create a new team called "Saturday Evening Worship," define positions (Worship Leader, 2 Vocalists, Guitar, Bass, Keys, Drums), and recruit from their existing Sunday teams. Some volunteers join both teams; others commit only to Saturday. Within 4 weeks, they have a rotating roster of 12 people covering 7 positions every Saturday.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario: Preventing Kids Ministry Burnout</h3>
      <p>
        First Baptist notices their children's ministry team is shrinking—volunteers keep quitting. They audit the data and discover that 3 people are serving 3-4 times per month while 8 others serve less than once a month. They rebalance the schedule to spread the load evenly, set maximum frequency rules (2x per month), and recruit 5 new volunteers to fill gaps. Within two months, retention improves and volunteers report feeling less overwhelmed.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario: Tech Team Training Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        Citylight Church has one sound engineer (Mike) and he's getting burned out. They create an apprentice position and recruit two interested volunteers. For 8 weeks, the apprentices shadow Mike during services, learning the mixing board and troubleshooting. By week 9, both are promoted to full Sound Engineer positions, tripling the team's bench strength. Mike now serves 1-2 times per month instead of every week.
